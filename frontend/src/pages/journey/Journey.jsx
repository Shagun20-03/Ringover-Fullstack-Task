          <h3>The Roots</h3>
          <p>
            Our entire life when we shop, we are limited by choices that are there in a store. We are often on the side where we buy our favourite coloured shoes made by
            someone elese but ehat if we designed it? What if we could involve in the making of a shoe we want to buy? This little thought sprouted to become what we are
            today, KICKSUP! ;)

          <h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
          <p>
            Understanding the trends in the industry and what the users think when they buy were our top priorities before we moved further in the building. After weeks of
            fruitful research, we stopped the user's shoes and look at what we plan to do. It's a great joy for the users if they are involved in the making. We're heading
            into an era of technology and people prefer online shopping to shopping in an outlet.

          <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
          <p>
           Every milestone begins with a single step before KICKSUP sprouted, the team manufactured in small scale with two users a month. This experience was
           crucial to our brand as this is our first practical experience. Interacting with the users was the best thing ever. The positive reviews and support from people
           motivated us to push our limits further.
